Like a pile of pancakes, the pancakes are both added and removed from the top. So when removing a pancake, it will always be the last pancake you added. This way of organizing elements is called LIFO: Last In First Out.

Basic operations we can do on a stack are:

Push: Adds a new element on the stack.
Pop: Removes and returns the top element from the stack.
Peek: Returns the top (last) element on the stack.
isEmpty: Checks if the stack is empty.
Size: Finds the number of elements in the stack.
